### Hi there 👋 I'm Luis a nerdy who loves computers
> Check out my [Stars](https://github.com/luisliz?tab=stars) I try to keep them organized, and I'm always exploring.

## Try Insighthub! (beta and name pending) [Insighthub](https://task.nix2k39.com)
- A time based kanban board task app
- Tracking of habits, things you consume and keep track of routines
- Organize tasks by category and projects

### 🎉 Fun Technical interests
- Nixos configuration used for
- Vim on IDEs & 👑 [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) for development
- Homelabbing
- Clouds I've tried: Hetzner for personal and Azure for work

### 🔭 Languages
- Work:
  - Current: Help work on some huge services in c# & Observability expert
  - Previous: C# (UWP) connected to OS in winRT c++
- Preferred: 👑 Go for apis & svelte
- Previously preferred: Vue
- Tried and meh:
  - Nextjs/React but if you pay enough I can do it
- Tried and someday hope to use:
  - F# - If I build an app I will likely use this stack (avalonia ui + MVU).
  - Odin - Awesome but mostly focused for games and will likely try more in the future.
    - Suggest @karl-zylinski book [Understanding Odin Programming Language](https://zylinski.itch.io/odinbook) 
  - Gleam - Great but kind of small ecosystem and no time to get into elixir and I would prefer to use it as a way to replace JS. 

### 🤯 Currently hosted & most used tools shout-outs
> These are things I basically shout out and use in my lab or for projects
- Pangolin - What i've always been waiting for and allows protected publicly exposed services. Does give some issues with apps. 
- Netbird - The best reverse proxy allowing you to control access from machines and pretty reliable (because of wireguard). Better than rolling your own wireguard. 
- Plane.so - Just the one I chose and good UI
- [JJ](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj) - CAN WE JUST MAKE THIS THE DEFAULT?! 
- Forgejo - I like because it's more aligned to switching from github. 
- Grist - More modern take of excel 
- Immich - Control your own pictures!!
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) - Self-hostable, cheap, does what it's meant and hasn't had breaches. Need I say more?
- Home assistant - Annoying af to deal with the UI but robust as a mofo. The cockroach of my lab
- Caddy - Best reverse proxy IMO for its simplicity and is the only one that has never failed.
- NixOS - The GOAT of hosting a lot of machines
  - Colmena - Fucking love for deploying better than ansible and terraform (mostly because of nixos)
  - Sops-nix - Secure your stuff!
  - [Determinate systems](https://determinate.systems/)
- PVE, Truenas & Unifi - I mean...classic

### 📖 Learning
- Currently goals to improve:
  - https://roadmap.sh/devops - Best one i'm at just for the nature of my job in services & hobbies. 
  - https://roadmap.sh/r/mba-self-taught - To fill gaps in my finance, economy and business knowledge.
  - https://roadmap.sh/r/operating-system-9f83n - Some professional experience, but trying to get deeper experience.
  - https://roadmap.sh/system-design - I have shallow knowledge on a lot of concepts, but need to deepen.
  - https://roadmap.sh/r/cpp-extended - I tell myself someday I'll be great in c++. 
- Platforms
  - Exercism - I use for brushing up on my fundamental skills
    - Personal progress: https://github.com/luisliz/exercism
  - Codecrafters - A little expensive but great idea and want to support this 
    - Free alternative by them https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x
    - My Progress:
      - Shell in Go & Gleam
      - Redis in Gleam
      - Interpreter in Odin

### 🥼 Tried but not actively using
- Nomad, consul & vault stack - Should be my main stack for home and someday will go back to hosting, but broke the cluster some time ago during an update. 
- Opnsense - Great and should work, but UI is counterintuitive, or I'm dumb. 
- Onedev - Great take on management and very robust but didn't really feel like adapting the CICD. Never really broke 

> These are kind of inaccurate I use my own git host
